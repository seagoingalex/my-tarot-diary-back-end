About this app
The art of tarot reading is a centuries-old skill that can be rather difficult to approach, let alone practice. Just as software engineering requires repetition and consistency to mastery, so does the intuition-developing nature of divination. While iOS and Android apps such as Golden Thread exist, web-based applications are lacking, as are functionality in existing applications to take notes, customize, and read for others

This full stack web application is designed as a modern and personal space to make the fun and joyful skill of tarot reading as approachable as any other hobby. By creating a password-secured profile, users can access a tarot database encompassing all cards within the major and minor arcana, a beginner’s guide to reading tarot, and a virtual deck where you can perform daily readings,  record multiple-card readings as they practice, and even document the readings of friends.
